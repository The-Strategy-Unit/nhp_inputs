### Background

Demographic changes translate into need or demand for healthcare via two main channels.

1. First, need for healthcare increases with the size of the population, as the needs of a larger population are proportionately greater than those of a smaller population.
2. Second, need increases with the proportion of older people in the population, because per capita utilisation tends to be higher for the old than the young.

The concept that, on average, a larger or older population will have a greater need for healthcare is uncomplicated.
However, in our experience little if any consideration is given to health status.
Studies show that the demand for and use of health care depends ultimately on the health status and functional ability of citizens. While age is a useful indicator of health status (as shown by the steep upward slope of age-related expenditure profiles), it is not the causal factor.

Methods that overlook or ignore health status implicitly assume that age-specific utilisation remains constant over time.
This "overlooks the fact that rising life expectancy makes … older people “younger”, healthier, and fitter than their peers in earlier cohorts", and risks overstating the effect of population aging on demand for health care.

### Theories of population aging

Good data on population health by age is limited and what evidence there is on secular trends in health status (prevalence of chronic conditions, disability, or self-assessed general health) presents a mixed picture.
There is an unsettled debate about how population health status will evolve in relation to the growing life expectancy—will the additional years of life that recent cohorts have gained (and stand to gain) be spent in good health or disability and frailty?
Alternative explanations for continued increases in life expectancy emphasise different causal factors and have different implications for morbidity in later life.

### Calibrating an adjustment for health status

An elicitation workshop on population health status took place in October 2022.
The purpose of the workshop was to help the Strategy Unit SU and New Hospitals Programme NHP reach a view about how population health status will evolve over the coming decades.
The specific quantity/parameter of interest QOI was:

> For a typical person of age 65 years in 2035, what proportion of their remaining life expectancy will be spent free of disability (i.e., without a limiting long-standing illness)?

The primary output from the workshop was a probability distribution summarizing the views of a group of experts about the QOI.
The distribution was for a fixed point in the future, 2035.
The remainder of this document describes a process for using that probability distribution to calibrate an adjustment for population health status as part of a method for estimating the impact of population aging on future demand for health care.
