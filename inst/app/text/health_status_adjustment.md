This adjustment accounts for potential changes in the health status of the population (very simply, will older people in
future be healthier than they are today?).

The adjustments included in this factor were calculated using the results from an elicitation workshop with subject
matter experts.
The results are applied automatically in the model, so no user inputs are required here.

See the [NHP model project information][hsa] site for some more details on this adjustment.
