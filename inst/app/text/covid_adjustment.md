The covid pandemic caused differing activity levels from what we would expect in a typical year.
For the year 2019/20, most of the year was unaffected, but the final month (March-2020) saw a drastic reduction in the usual levels of activity.

In order to use 2019/20 as a baseline year, we need to oversample activity from the rest of the year.
The method we use comes from NHS England.
