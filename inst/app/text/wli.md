Often, providers may tackle waiting list by putting on additional activity to tackle backlogs. This poses a problem for our modelling method, which asumes that the baseline year is representative of a standard year.

We account for this by reducing elective inpatient activity and outpatient attendances.

Enter the amount of additional admissions / outpatient attendances that occured in the baseline year to clear waiting lists. The value next to the input shows the percentage reduction to the baseline data that will occur.
