The are two NDG 'Variants' that can be selected from the dropdown below:

* Variant 2 (NDG2) is the _primary_ non-demographic adjustment rate. 
Demand projections described in the co-authored output report will be based on the use of Variant 2. 
* Variant 3 (NDG3) is used for _sensitivity analysis_ only.
The impact of using Variant 3 instead of Variant 2 on projected demand can be explored in the output report.
