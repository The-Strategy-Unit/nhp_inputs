These change factors reflect demand-supply imbalances and are intended to
reflect marginal changes in market share (as opposed to e.g. system
reconfiguration).

### Expatriation

This adjustment accounts for the expected reductions in the current number of patients treated at the hospital because they will receive care elsewhere in the future. For example, if the new hospital will no longer delivery a particular specialty.

100% means no change due to expatriation. 95% means 5% of current activity would be ‘expatriated’ (treated elsewhere). A value of 0% would mean all activity is ‘expatriated’.

### Repatriation - Local

This adjustment accounts for the number of local ICB patients not currently treated at the hospital that will be in the future. For example, if the new hospital plans to increase the capacity of a particular specialty to address a historic under provision which has resulted in local ICB patients travelling further to other trusts.

100% means no change. 105% means a 5% increase in activity.

### Repatriation - Non-Local

This adjustment accounts for an expected increase in non local patients (patients living outside of the local ICB) . For example, if the new hospital includes a larger specialist ophthalmology department that it expects will attract patients from outside of the local area.

100% means no change. 105% means a 5% increase in current levels of non local activity.
