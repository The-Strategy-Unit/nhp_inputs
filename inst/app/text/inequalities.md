Access to some hospital services are known to vary between socio-economic groups.

In particular, several studies have shown that patient access to planned hospital care are lower for patients living in more deprived areas, having adjusted for need.  Reducing health inequalities and inequities in access to services is a long-standing national policy objective.


Inequalities present in the baseline year will be carried forward in the NHP demand and activity model unless some adjustment is applied.  This paper sets out how the ‘inequalities’ change factor might be implemented in the model.  The approach builds on detailed analysis carried out by the Strategy Unit, which explored socio-economic inequalities in access to planned hospital care.
