Access to some hospital services are known to vary between socio-economic groups.

In particular, several studies have shown that patient access to planned hospital care are lower for patients living in more deprived areas, having adjusted for need.  Reducing health inequalities and inequities in access to services is a long-standing national policy objective.

Inequalities present in the baseline year will be carried forward in the NHP demand and activity model unless some adjustment is applied.  This paper sets out how the ‘inequalities’ change factor might be implemented in the model.  The approach builds on detailed analysis carried out by the Strategy Unit, which explored socio-economic inequalities in access to planned hospital care.

For many forms of planned hospital care, activity levels are lower, relative to need in more deprived populations.  These effects can be visualised as in the graph below, with the blue dots indicating the observed activity rates for each decile of deprivation and the dashed orange line representing a regression line fitted to the data. The gradient from most to least deprived areas indicates the direction and scale of inequality. If no inequity were present, then the regression line would be horizontal.
