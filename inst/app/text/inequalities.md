This adjustment allows a scheme to estimate future demand while explicitly assuming that current inequalities in planned care will be eliminated.  Where inequalities are present in the baseline year, they will be carried forward in the NHP demand model *unless some adjustment is applied*. This adjustment does not consider the methods by which any inequality will be reduced. 

For each Healthcare Resource Group (HRG), the activity rate in the baseline year is plotted against quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation ([IMD19](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019)) of the patientâ€™s residence, and a straight line is fitted through the five points (grey line). Each HRG with a statistically significant positive linear gradient is considered to have evidence of inequality, and is shown here.  For each HRG shown, the user must choose whether and how removal of this inequality will occur by the horizon year, via one of the following options, which will be shown on the plot as a red horizontal line:  

A. 'Level-up': by the horizon year, the activity rate for this HRG will have increased in all quintiles to match the fitted activity rate in quintile 5 (the least deprived group). In this situation, the rate in the least deprived quintile is not adjusted. 

B. 'Level-down': by the horizon year, the activity rate for this HRG will have reduced in all quintiles to the fitted rate of the most deprived quintile (quintile 1, with a minimum activity rate of zero). The rate in the least deprived quintile is not changed. 

C. 'Zero-sum redistribution': by the horizon year, the activity rate for this HRG in all quintiles will have increased or decreased to match the mean activity rate across the whole HRG. This means that activity rates across all quintiles will be the same, and that total levels of activity remain the same as in the baseline year. 

D.  No change: Inequality in delivery for this HRG will remain as it is in the baseline year.
