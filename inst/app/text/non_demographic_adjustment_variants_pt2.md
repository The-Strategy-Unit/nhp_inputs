To use Variant 3 for comparative purposes:

1. Select 'create new from existing' from the NHP Model Inputs landing page.
2. Choose the 'previous scenario' you wish to run again using Variant 3.
3. Choose a new, unique name e.g. '[previous-scenario-name]-ndg3'.
4. Select 'Variant 3' from the dropdown on this page. For a true comparison, all other parameters should remain the same.

Currently, the non-demographic adjustment for inpatients maternity activity is set at 1 (in both Variants) which represents no change.
This assumption is currently under review and may be revised in later versions of the model.

For more information about the use of Variant 2 and Variant 3 see [the project information site](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/modelling_methodology/non-demographic_growth.html).
