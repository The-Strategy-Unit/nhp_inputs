This input allows users to choose from the population projection variants produced by ONS. The principal projection is set as the default. The slider indicates what percentage of the Monte Carlo simulation runs will use each variant. To set 60% of the runs to use Principal Projection and 40% of the runs to use High Fertility, then the slider should be set to 60 for the former and 40 for the latter.

To use only one population projection for all Monte Carlo Simulation runs the slider should be set to 100% for that population projection.

Where an alternative variant is selected, the user should provide reasons and evidence to support the choice.

Further information on the different population projections is available from the [project information site](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/modelling_methodology/demographic_modelling/demographic_modelling.html).
