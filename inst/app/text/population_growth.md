This input allows users to choose from the population projection variants produced by ONS. The principal projection is set as the default. The slider indicates what percentage of the Monte Carlo simulation runs will use each variant. To set 60% of the runs to use Principal Projection and 40% of the runs to use High Fertility, then the slider should be set to 60 for the former and 40 for the latter.

Should trusts want to only use one population projection for all Monte Carlo Simulation runs then they can pick that one and set the slider to 100%.

Where an alternative variant is selected, the trust should provide reasons and evidence to support the choice.

Further information on the different population projections is available from the [project information site](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/modelling_methodology/demographic_modelling/demographic_modelling.html).
