This input allows users to choose from the population projection variants produced by ONS. The principal projection is set as default. Should trusts wish to pick an alternative variant that will be applied to their model they should select a single variant and set the slider for that variant to 100%.

Where an alternative variant is selected the trust should provide reasons and evidence to support the choice.
