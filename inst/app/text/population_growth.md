This input allows users to choose from the 2022 population projection variants produced by ONS.
The migration variant projection is set as the default as that is what ONS regard as the principal projection for subnational variants.
This is the variant you should use for NHP related models.
Other choices may be permitted but will require valid reasons and evidence to support an alternative choice.
Please discuss with your model relationship manager before selecting an alternative variant. 


Further information on the different population projections is available from [the project information site](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/modelling_methodology/demographic_modelling/demographic_modelling.html).
