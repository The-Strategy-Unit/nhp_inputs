This input allows users to choose from the 2022 population projection variants produced by ONS.
The migration variant projection is set as the default as that is what ONS regard as the principal projection for subnational variants.
This is the variant you should use for NHP related models.
Other choices may be permitted but will require valid reasons and evidence to support an alternative choice.
Please discuss with your model relationship manager before selecting an alternative variant. 
 
Whilst it is possible to apply multiple projections within a model (with each single Monte Carlo simulation run selecting proportionally from each of the variants selected) it is currently mandated that you should only select a single variant.
To do this the slider should be set to 100% for the selected population variant.
Further information on the different population projections is available from [the project information site](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/modelling_methodology/demographic_modelling/demographic_modelling.html).
