The non-demographic growth (NDG) adjustment accounts for the growth in activity that is not due to changes in the size and age-sex structure of the population over time.

The NDG adjustment rates applied across different activity types are shown in the table on this page.
The table values update with the NDG Variant selected from the dropdown below. 

Note that no NDG adjustment rate is applied to length of stay.
