This adjustment accounts for the growth in activity which is _not_ due to changes in the size and age-sex structure of the population over time.

This adjustment is based on detailed analysis to quantify growth after accounting for changes in population size and structure. No user inputs are required for this factor but the adjustments made within their model are shown for information.

Non-demographic growth is currently not applied for inpatients maternity activity. The parameter is set at 1 which represents no change. This assumption is currently under review and may be revised in later versions of the model.
