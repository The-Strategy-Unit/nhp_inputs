For comparative purposes, Variant 1 can be selected for subsequent runs of the model. This can be done by selecting ‘create new from existing’ from the NHP Model Inputs landing page and choosing the ‘previous scenario’ you wish to run again using Variant 1 (you will need to choose a new name e.g. ‘[previous-scenario-name]-ndg1’). For a true comparison, all other parameters should remain the same as the previous scenario. 

Note that the:

* Variant 2 non-elective IP factor results in a -0.14% (-0.45%/0.17%) annual adjustment.
* Variant 1 non-elective IP factor results in a 2.17% (1.94%/2.4%) annual adjustment.
