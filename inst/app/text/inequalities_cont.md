Please select whether and how you anticipate that inequalities in access to planned hospital care will be eliminated by the model horizon year. Users will have four options to select from.

A)	No change
B)	Level-up 
C)	Level-down
D)	Zero-sum redistribution

Levelling-up can be seen as changing the activity rates in all deciles so that they equal the fitted rate in the least deprived decile.  In contrast, levelling down adjusts all activity rates so that the rates in each decile is equal to the fitted rate in the most deprived decile.  Zero-sum redistribution involves changing the rates in each decile so that the rates are equal in all deciles, but the total level of activity remains unchanged.

These options are illustrated by the green lines in the three graphs below.  For more information about these three routes to equity and the circumstances when they might be applied, please refer to  [this report](https://www.midlandsdecisionsupport.nhs.uk/knowledge-library/strategies-to-reduce-inequalities-in-access-to-planned-hospital-procedures/).
