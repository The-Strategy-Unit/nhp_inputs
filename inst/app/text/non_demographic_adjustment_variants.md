For non-elective inpatients, Variant 2 is run by default and must be used for the first run of the model (this is the primary rate used for non-elective IP in this current modelling round). For more information about the use of Variant 2 see [the project information site](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/modelling_methodology/non-demographic_growth.html).
