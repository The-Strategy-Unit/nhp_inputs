[Enhanced Recovery][1] is an evidence based model that is intended to help patients recover from major elective surgery quicker than they normally would do. It is based on the following principles:

- the patient is in the best possible condition for surgery
- the patient has the best possible management during and after his/her operation
- the patient experiences the best post-operative rehabilitation

Whilst many procedures would benefit from adopting enhanced recovery approaches the most common specialties where enhanced recovery programmes have been implemented are MSK, colorectal surgery, gynaecology and urology as these were the areas targeted by the Department of Health enhanced recovery programme. The 2011 programme report specified a number of high volume procedures within these specialties that would be the focus of ER programmes and it is these that are included within th ER efficiency factors. In addition we have subsequently also included a number of breast surgery procedures as more recent [NHS][2] information identifies this as an area where ER programmes are commonly in place.
