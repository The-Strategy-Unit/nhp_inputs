Day surgery is now established practice with rates continuing to increase. Due to advances in anaesthesia and surgical techniques, it is the standard pathway of care for many complex patients and procedures traditionally treated through inpatient pathways.

Day surgery represents high-quality patient care with excellent patient satisfaction. Shorter hospital stays and early mobilization reduce rates of hospital-acquired infection and venous thromboembolism. Patients overwhelmingly endorse day surgery, with smaller waiting times, less risk of cancellation, lower rates of infection, and the preference of their own surroundings to convalesce. 

The British Association of Day Surgery (BADS) produce a Directory of Procedures which identifes surgical interventions that can be delivered in a day case or outpatient setting  instead of an elective ordinary inpatient setting which often results in an  overnight stay. For each procedure the directory provides an indication of the percentage of spells that could be carried out in each setting.

The model identifies spells using the basket of procedures provided by BADS and classifies them into four categories based in the indicative percentages contained in the directory 

- Procedures predominantly (>66%) recommended to be carried out in a procedure room
- Procedures predominantly (>66%) recommended to be carried out either in a day case or a procedure room (OP) setting
- Procedures predominantly (>66%) recommended to be carried out in a day case setting
- Procedures occasionally (5 to 33%) recommended to be carried out in a day case setting
