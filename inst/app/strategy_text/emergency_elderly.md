The model identifies all patients aged over 75 admitted as an emergency.
These patients typically have long lengths of stay and thus represent a significant efficiency opportunity through process improvements, interventions or pathway developments that help to reduce LOS.
Older people with frailty is also one of the core pathways where the development of virtual wards is focussed and therefore patients in this activity cohort may be suitable for earlier discharge through admission to a step down virtual ward.
