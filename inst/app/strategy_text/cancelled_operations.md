There are instances where a patient has been admitted into hospital but later finds that their procedure has been cancelled resulting in a discharge. This is inefficient for the provider and costly for the commissioner as they both incur an unnecessary opportunity cost. These spells are identified via the HRG code `WA14Z` (formerly `S22`) which is defined as "planned procedure not carried out".
