Operations can be cancelled after a patient has been admitted this is inefficient for the provider and costly for the commissioner as they both incur an unnecessary opportunity cost. Cancelled operations can be for a variety of clinical, administrative or patient related reasons. Some of these admissions could be avoided through for example improved administration and scheduling or enhanced pre-op patient optimisation and assessment.

These spells are identified via the HRG codes which identity spells where the planned procedure was not carried out.

HRG codes are published annually by [NHS England][1].
