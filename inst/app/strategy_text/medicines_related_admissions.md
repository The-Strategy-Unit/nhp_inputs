[Between 5 and 10%][1] of all hospital admissions may be medicines related. Such admissions can occur due to drug therapy failure, adverse reactions to drug therapy, failure to adhere to prescribed regimen or unintentional overdose.   Admissions of this type could be prevented with better self management on the patients' part or improved medicines management.

The model identifies these admissions using two approaches.

The first identifies admissions where the presence of one or more of a number of ICD10 cause codes indicate the use of a medicine is a factor in the admission.

Admissions where there is an explicit cause code probably underestimate the true number of medicines related admissions. Therefore the second approach identifies admissions where a medicines related cause is not explicitly recorded but may be a factor in the admission.

In order to do this the model identifies admissions with a specific combination of primary and secondary diagnoses that are indicative of a medicine related cause. For example the long term use of high dose NSAIDs is a possible cause of an admission with a primary diagnosis of gastric ulcer and a secondary diagnosis of arthritis.

The list of diagnoses used within the coding of this factor is based on exploratory work undertaken by the strategy Unit. Other valid combinations could potentially be added to current set.
