The Directory of Ambulatory Emergency Care for Adults published by the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement identified 49 emergency conditions that have the potential to be managed as an emergency day case that could be delivered in a Same-Day Emergency Care (SDEC) unit.
We have grouped these conditions into four mitigator cohorts, those that the institute suggest have a:

* low potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (10-30% of cases)
* moderate potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (30-60% of cases)
* high potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (60-90% of cases)
* very high potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (90-100% of cases)

The spells identified by these mitigators exclude any with a length-of-stay (LOS) of >=3 days as these spells are considered less likely to be treatable within a day.
This mitigator allows Trusts to make an assumption about what proportion of the identified spells they think will, in future, be delivered within an SDEC facility and not as an admitted patient.
The model removes this quantity of spells from the inpatient data and adds them to the A&E outputs as type 5 (SDEC) attendances enabling clear identification and quantification of future SDEC activity with the model outputs.

Note: these mitigators replace the previous set of Ambulatory Emergency Care (AEC) efficiency mitigators that adjusted the LOS of selected spells to 0 LOS but kept them within the inpatient dataset.
The change reflects the new requirement for Trusts to record SDEC activity within the Emergency Care Dataset (ECDS).
