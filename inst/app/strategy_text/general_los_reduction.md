Historically there has been a sustained and continuing reduction in average LOS. 

The model allows users to make assumptions about future reductions in LOS relating to some specific activity cohorts eg for over 75 patients admitted as an emergency but it is recognised that continued LOS reductions may also continue to be achieved for patients outside of these specific cohorts.

This type of potentially mitigatable activity (TPMA) therefore allows users to set assumptions about the expected reduction in the average LOS for emergency and elective spells that are not covered by the other specific efficiency TPMAs.
