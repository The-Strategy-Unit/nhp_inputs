Sometimes a patient will stay in hospital for longer than expected. Expected lengths of stay are calculated for each spell based on the upper quartile length of stay for the HRG plus 1.5 times the inter-quartile range of length of stay. This is known as the "Trim point". 

Hospitals are reimbursed for additional days in excess of the trim point via an excess bed day payment. Excess Bed Days can also be costly for providers as the payment does not cover the full costs of the additional stay. 

In some instances excess bed days may be avoidable for example where the excess bed days are as a result of delayed discharges or sub optimal rehabilitation support.

Trim Points are updated annually and can be found in the [national tariff workbooks][1].
