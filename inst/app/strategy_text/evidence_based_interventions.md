The Evidence-based Interventions programme is an initiative led by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges to improve the quality of care. It is designed to reduce the number of medical or surgical interventions as well as some other tests and treatments which the evidence tells us are inappropriate for some patients in some circumstances. The programme identified a range of tests, treatments and procedures that could in some instances be unnecessary and as such avoidable through for example improved policies, pathway redesign, referral management.

The model adapts SQL code developed by the programme to identify spells where relevant surgical procedures (along with specified diagnoses) are undertaken. It groups those procedures into surgical specialties.

Codes used within the model to identify spells of this type can be found on the [AMRC website][1].
