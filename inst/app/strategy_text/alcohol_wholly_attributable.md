Research into alcohol related hospitalisation (Jones 2013) suggests there are a number of admissions that are attributable to excess alcohol consumption which can ultimately lead to an emergency hospital admission or even death. By raising public awareness against the harms of excessive alcohol consumption and having primary care interventions in place, it may be possible to avoid these admissions.

Here, the groupings used by Jones and Bellis have been modified, leaving:

* Wholly attributable to alcohol consumption (100%);
* Partially attributable to alcohol consumption (Acute conditions);
* Partially attributable to alcohol consumption (Chronic conditions).

We have addressed several shortcomings of the methods used previously to calculate England-specific Alchol Attributable Fractions (AAFs). While the figures presented here provide a more accurate estimate of the harm attributable to alcohol consumption, they are still likely to be a conservative estimate given the continuing limitations and uncertainties in the current research evidence.
