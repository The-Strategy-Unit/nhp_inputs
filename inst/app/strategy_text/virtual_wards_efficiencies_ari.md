Virtual wards allow patients to receive the care they need at home, safely and conveniently rather than in hospital.
They also provide systems with a significant opportunity to narrow the gap between demand and capacity for secondary care beds, by providing an alternative to admission and/or early discharge.

Whilst virtual wards may be beneficial for patients on a variety of clinical pathways guidance has been produced relating to three pathways which represent the majority of patients who may be clinically suitable to benefit from a virtual ward.
These pathways are Frailty, Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) and Heart failure.

This efficiency mitigator identifies patients who may be suitable for earlier discharge through admission to a step down ARI virtual ward.
