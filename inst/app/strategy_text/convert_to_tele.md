Not every outpatient appointment requires the patient to be physically present. In particular some routine follow up appointments such as those that follow procedures or those aimed at monitoring treatment progress could be carried out virtually. Virtual attendances deliver many benefits including:

- protecting patients, staff and the community,
- reducing costs for patients and their carers/families,
- improving patient satisfaction,
- reducing carbon emissions from travelling to appointments,
- increased opportunities for flexible working for clinicians.
