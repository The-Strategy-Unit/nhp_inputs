These injuries are a common and serious problem for older people. People aged 65 and older have the highest risk of falling, with 30% of people older than 65 and 50% of people older than 80 falling at least once a year. Effective fall prevention strategies can reduce the number of people who fall, the rate of falls and the severity of injury should a fall occur. We identify admissions where the patient is 65 years-old or over, is admitted as an emergency, and at least one diagnosis code from the following three groups is present:

* Explicit – where a fall is indicated as a cause (e.g. `W06 – fall involving bed`);
* Implicit – where the patient is recorded as having a tendency to fall (`R296 – tendency to fall NEC`);
* Implicit – fractures commonly resulting from a fall (e.g. `S424 – fracture of lower end of humerus`).

These three groups are not - by definition - exclusive of one another.
