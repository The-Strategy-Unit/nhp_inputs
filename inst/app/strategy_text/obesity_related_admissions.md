Obesity is a factor that increases the risk of developing a wide range of conditions. Reducing the level of obesity within the population though greater investment in lifestyle management services and health promotion would reduce the number of admissions for conditions that are at least in part attributable to obesity.

The National Audit Office publication Tackling Obesity in England 2001 identified conditions that are attributable to obesity. The publication provides an indication, for each condition, of the proportion of cases that may be attributable to obesity. The model uses this information to identify admissions  and classifies them into those that are either entirely attributable to obesity (100%), somewhat attributable to obesity (10%-50%), or marginally attributable to obesity (<10%).
