## About

An app to input the parameters needed to run scenarios through the New Hospital Programme (NHP) demand model.

The app is [deployed to Posit Connect](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/inputs/). You must have an account and sufficient permissions to view it.

You can find more information on [the NHP model project information site](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/), including [a diagram](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/project_plan_and_summary/components-overview.html) of how the components of the modelling process fit together.

## For developers

The app is built and maintained by members of the Strategy Unit's Data Science team.

### Structure

The app is built primarily with [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) and [the {golem} package](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/). Server and UI modules can be found in `R/`, configuration in `inst/golem-config.yml` and supporting data and text in `inst/app/`. [The {renv} package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) is used for dependency management.

### Run locally

Add an `.Renviron` file to the project root that contains the required environment variables. You can get these from a member of the Data Science team.

The inputs app is on the `main` branch, but the selection app (where users start or edit a scenario) is in the `inputs_selection_app` branch. Use Git’s `worktree` function to add that branch to its own folder in your development branch:

```
git fetch origin inputs_selection_app
git worktree add inputs_selection_app inputs_selection_app
```

To run the app from RStudio, start up the selection app by opening the `dev/watch.R` script, go to the ‘Background Jobs’ tab of the console pane and click the ‘Start Background Job’ button. Hit 'Start' in the ‘Run Script as Background Job’ dialog box. When ready, the app will tell you to visit `http://127.0.0.1:9081/` in your browser. Note that your selections in the app remain local to you.

If you need to remove the selection-app folder at any point, you can do that with:

```
git worktree remove inputs_selection_app 
```

### Data extraction

The app displays trust-specific data to users. The data is processed via Databricks scripts in [the nhp_data repository](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_data) and stored in Azure storage.

### Deployment

Deployment is controlled by GitHub Actions, where:

* pushes to the `main` branch redeploy the app to /nhp/dev/inputs/ for purposes of quality assurance
* tagged releases trigger a new deployment to /nhp/vX-Y/inputs/, where 'vX-Y' is the current version (note the hyphen)
